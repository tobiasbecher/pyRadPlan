"""
Python package for radiation therapy treatment planning.

We recommend reading the documentation on `GitHub <https://github.com/e0404/pyRadPlan>`_.

This package provides
- Core classes and functions for treatment planning.
- Dose influence matrix calculations and data structures.
- Physical and biological quantities for treatment planning.
- Optimization and analysis tools for radiation therapy plans.
- Sequencing and visualization tools for radiation therapy plans.

Import packages as follows:

    from pyRadPlan import (
        load_tg119,
        PhotonPlan,
        generate_stf,
        calc_dose_influence,
        fluence_optimization,
        plot_slice,
    )

Use the documentation, docstrings or examples for a detailed overview.
